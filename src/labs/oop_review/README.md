## Instructions
Create a small animal program from the starter code. The code has many issues, your task is to reorganize the code using basic Object Oriented Principles, and fix any bugs or bad practices it may have. 

1) Identify the issues in the code.
    -  Creating pseudocode or a UML may be very helpful
2) Refactor the code into classes using encapsulation, inheritance, composition, polymorphism or any other design principle.
    - I am expecting that inheritance and composition are both used. 
    - Create a class for each animal type (lion, capybara, etc.)
3) Update the code so its a little more user friendly
4) Implement the TODO.

From a user perspective, the current program needs only be able to tell the user whether an animal is an herbivore, carnivore, or omnivore, and what sound an animal makes.

This assignment assumes that the "company" needing this code will be making a list of foods the animal eats, where the animal is located, and will have more animals that will eventually be populated automatically using csv. Do not implement these potential updates (this class will not use them, but they are examples of why we should be using OOP).
