# Instructions
In this lab you will utilize the base code located here. You will be adding more classes to the base code.

Add the following updates to the code:
1) Create two new "Pizza Shops"
    - Create them how you wish
2) Create new ingredient factories for the new shops
3) Create at least 4 new ingredients
4) Create at least 2 new Pizza types, that will be used in all shops.
5) *VERY IMPORTANT:* This code will be submitted as a PR as normal, but before submitting your PR, merge the base example code into your repo. This way the PR will show the differences between the base code and what you created. This will be part of the grade.  
6) Ensure the code adheres to SOLID coding principles
    - Ensure your code adheres to all other standards as well
