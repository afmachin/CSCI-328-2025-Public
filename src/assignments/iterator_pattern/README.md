# Instructions
In this assignment you will utilize the base code located on github. You will need to identify how to refactor the code in order to implement usage of the Iterator Pattern and execute said refactor.

1) You will need to implement the empty classes to apply the iterator pattern
    1) Many of the classes have TODOs. You must implement them.
    2) You will need to use both the Java implementation of Iterator and create your own.
    3) There are two collections / aggregates
        - One will use an ArrayList for it's backend
        - The other will use an array
    4) There are two Iterators
        - One will implement Java's Iterator Class
        - One will implement a user created Iterator Class (MyIterator)
    5) The main class(MenuTest) should have very few updates
        - You will uncomment the code
        - You  will ensure the client has what it needs (there are several ways to implement this).
2) Ensure the code adheres to SOLID coding principles
    - Ensure your code adheres to all other standards as well
